*Welcome to the zepto wiki!*

I'm delighted to see you! Please feel free to look around.
There is section called Getting Started which might be most
relevant if you are not experienced with any Lisp-derivative.
If you are, I would advise you to have a look at the more "advanced"
topics, such as [IO](https://github.com/hellerve/zepto/wiki/IO),
[Math](https://github.com/hellerve/zepto/wiki/Math) or the 
[Advanced Features Already Implemented](https://github.com/hellerve/zepto/wiki/Advanced-Features-Already-Implemented) page.

If you want to contribute, please look at the [Contributing](https://github.com/hellerve/zepto/wiki/Contributing) page or
the Advanced Features page that I already mentioned. *Have fun!*

If you run into trouble at any time, feel free to contact me by
any means necessary that do not involve breaking my door.
